execises 1.1. - 1.14.

The application runs:
    npm start

The application runs on localhost 3000:
    http://localhost:3000

The files App.css, App.test.js, index.css, logo.svg, setupTests.js and reportWebVitals.js may be deleted as they are not needed in our application right now.

In some situations you may also have to run the command below from the root of the project:
    rm -rf node_modules/ && npm i
(If and when you encounter an error message
    Objects are not valid as a React child)

Notes for me:
Create an application:
    npx create-react-app name_for_folder

    cd name_for_folder
